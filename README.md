Current Project Under Development: 
  
  Mapping of Halligan (our Computer Science Building) using the Turtlebot's "Kinect" sensor, and implementing a leg-detection   service that will generate a heatmap of traffic in main hallways. Ideally the Turtlebot will learn using the heatmap of       "hot" places and move around them as it autonomously travels through the hallways. 
  
  Current Map of Halligan Level 1:
